I developed a website that provides an intuitive experience for exploring information about different countries. Users can search for specific countries, filter them by region, and access detailed data by clicking on the country of interest. This project combines functionality and ease of use to provide an informative and practical platform about world geography. I achieved this by structuring the data using a data.json file, ensuring efficient organization and retrieval of information.
